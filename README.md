## Walmart Sales Data Analysis - Predictive Modeling & Business Intelligence

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Walmart's weekly sales data (2010–2012) to develop accurate sales forecasting models and generate actionable business insights. The analysis combines advanced machine learning techniques with interactive data visualization.

## Key Objectives
- Develop accurate weekly sales forecasting models  
- Identify key factors influencing sales performance  
- Analyze seasonal patterns and holiday effects  
- Provide actionable business recommendations  

## Dataset
- **Source**: Walmart Weekly Sales Data (2010–2012)  
- **Records**: 6,435 weekly observations  
- **Features**: 8 columns including time-series and store information  

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling  
- **Tableau**: Interactive data visualization and dashboard creation  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## Methodology
### 1. Data Preparation
- Handling missing values and data cleaning  
- Feature engineering (time-based features)  
- Train-test split (80–20 time series split)  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Sales trend analysis across 45 stores  
- Correlation analysis between variables  
- Holiday effect quantification (+7.8% sales increase)  

### 3. Machine Learning Modeling
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Regression  
- **Target**: Weekly sales prediction  
- **Key Predictor**: 4-week rolling average (95.8% importance)  

## Model Performance
- **Accuracy**: 95.65%  
- **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**: 4.35%  
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: $43,840 per week  

## Key Findings
- **Strongest Predictor**: 4-week rolling average (95.8% feature importance)  
- **Holiday Impact**: Significant 7.8% increase in sales during holidays  
- **External Factors**: Unemployment and CPI have minimal impact  
- **Store Performance**: Significant variation across 45 stores  

## Visualizations
### Python Outputs
- Sales trend analysis charts  
- Correlation heatmaps  
- Feature importance visualizations  

### Tableau Dashboard
- Interactive sales trends  
- Actual vs. predicted comparison  
- Store performance ranking  
- Seasonal patterns heatmap  

## Business Insights & Recommendations
### Strategic Recommendations
- Implement 4-week rolling average for sales forecasting  
- Focus improvement efforts on low-performing stores  
- Optimize inventory management during holiday seasons  

### Technical Recommendations
- Deploy model for automated weekly forecasting  
- Implement real-time data integration  
- Expand analysis to product-level insights
